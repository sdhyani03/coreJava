A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized
We can apply static keyword with variables, methods, blocks and nested classes.
	The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading
	this and super cannot be used in static context.
	static block is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
this is a reference variable that refers to the current object
